# mirror-direnv

OCX mirror for [direnv](https://github.com/direnv/direnv). One repository, one
spec directory per package.

| Package | Spec | Publishes to | Announced as | Upstream SPDX |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| [direnv](https://github.com/direnv/direnv) | [`direnv/mirror.yml`](direnv/mirror.yml) | `ghcr.io/ocx-contrib/direnv/direnv` | `ocx.sh/direnv/direnv` | `MIT` |

Each upstream release is discovered, re-bundled, smoke-tested per
`(version, platform)` and only then pushed with cascade tags, after which the
result is announced into the OCX index.

> This repository previously published the same upstream to the flat coordinate
> `ocx.sh/direnv`. `direnv/direnv` is the grouped successor — upstream's owner
> is the org `direnv`, so namespace and name coincide.

## Layout

```
mirror-base.yml         repo-wide policy every spec inherits via `extends:`
direnv/
├── mirror.yml          the spec — never at the repo root
├── metadata.json       bundle interface
├── CATALOG.md          → ocx package describe
├── logo.svg / logo.png describe assets, 512px PNG
└── tests/smoke.star    Starlark smoke test
```

`LICENSE` and `NOTICE.md` are shared at the root. Logos are **not** — each
package carries its own, because a repo-root `logo.*` sits in no workflow's
`paths:` filter, so replacing it would publish nothing until some unrelated
edit happened to fire.

⚠️ `extends:` is a **shallow** merge of top-level keys. A spec that restates
`platforms:` to change one runner drops every `containers:` entry with it, and
nothing reds — the legs simply stop existing, and every `os.features` claim
goes back to being asserted rather than verified. Restate a block in full or
not at all.

## Platforms

`direnv` publishes six platform entries: both Linux arches, both macOS arches
and both Windows arches. Upstream builds direnv as a pure-Go binary without
cgo, so there is one Linux build per arch and it is **fully static** — no
`PT_INTERP`, no `DT_NEEDED`, and no musl/glibc variants to choose between.
`os.features` states what an artifact requires *of the host*, so both Linux
keys are **bare**: tagging them `+libc.musl` would be a false requirement that
hid them from every glibc host. The `alpine:3.20` container leg in
`mirror-base.yml` is what turns that claim into evidence; the measurement
itself is recorded above the `assets:` block in `direnv/mirror.yml`.

Upstream stopped suffixing the Windows assets with `.exe` in 2.37.0, which is
also the version floor — `asset_type.platforms` names the Windows binaries
`direnv.exe` explicitly so the bundle resolves on `PATH` like a normal Windows
tool.

## The bash caveat — why the smoke test looks thin

The **binary** is static and requires nothing of the host. The **tool** shells
out to `bash` to evaluate an `.envrc`, and `alpine:3.20` ships no bash, so
inside that container leg:

| Command | alpine:3.20 |
|---|---|
| `direnv version` / `--help` / `hook` / `dump` / `apply_dump` | exit 0, working |
| `direnv status`, `direnv allow`, any `.envrc` load | exit 1 — `can't find bash` |

`direnv/tests/smoke.star` is therefore **bash-free by construction**: it proves
real computation with the `dump` → `apply_dump` codec round-trip (a token in,
an opaque zlib+base64 blob out, the token back) rather than with an `.envrc`.
Adding a `status`/`allow`/`export` assertion reds both alpine legs — and those
legs are the only evidence behind the bare platform keys, so dropping them to
"fix" the test would quietly downgrade the libc claim to an assertion.

## Editing

| File | Edit | Regenerate after |
|------|------|------------------|
| `mirror-base.yml`, `direnv/mirror.yml` | hand | yes — see below |
| `direnv/{metadata.json,CATALOG.md,logo.*}` | hand | — |
| `direnv/tests/smoke.star` | hand | — |
| `.github/workflows/*.yml` | **generated — never hand-edit** | re-run when a spec changes |

```bash
ocx-mirror package pipeline generate ci --spec direnv/mirror.yml
```

**Name every spec.** `--spec` *appends* rather than replaces, so a command
naming a subset silently stops rendering the rest while staying green — and the
drift guard reds on a generated workflow the current spec set no longer
produces.

`verify-generated.yml` exits 65 on drift. If a generated workflow is wrong, the
spec or the renderer template is wrong — fix it there and regenerate.

Run `direnv allow` once to put the pinned toolchain on `PATH`, and invoke
`ocx-mirror` directly — never `ocx run -- ocx-mirror`, which pins
`OCX_BINARY_PIN` to the bootstrap `ocx` and false-reds the nested push.

## The binaries claim

direnv ships as a raw binary, so the bundle's only PATH entry is a bare
`${installPath}` — the executable *is* the content root. `bin_scan` only looks
*below* an `${installPath}/<dir>` entry, so `auto`/`verify` is rejected at spec
load with exit 65. `mirror-base.yml` therefore sets `bin_scan: off` and
`direnv/metadata.json` hand-lists `binaries: ["direnv"]` — the blessed shape
for this asset type.
